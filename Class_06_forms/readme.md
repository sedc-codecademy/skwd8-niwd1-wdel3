## Template forms

Template-driven forms use two-way data binding to update the data model in the component as changes are made in the template and vice versa.

## Reactive forms

Reactive forms provide a model-driven approach to handling form inputs whose values change over time. This guide shows you how to create and update a basic form control, progress to using multiple controls in a group, validate form values, and create dynamic forms where you can add or remove controls at run time.
