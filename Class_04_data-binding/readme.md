# Angular

Angular is an application design framework and development platform for creating efficient and sophisticated single-page apps.

## Data binding
Data-binding is a mechanism for coordinating what users see, specifically with application data values. While you could push values to and pull values from HTML, the application is easier to write, read, and maintain if you turn these tasks over to a binding framework. You simply declare bindings between binding sources, target HTML elements, and let the framework do the rest.
